      To be successful, IT graduates need to understand the use of industry tools and practices, the ways these tools work and connect together, and the underlying employability skills needed for successful practice as an IT professional. This unit introduces students to IT workflows, agile project management, dev-ops pipelines, version control, and the ways these tools fit together in modern companies. The use of these technologies is underpinned by the professional behaviours, teamwork and ethical considerations needed to engage in working in IT in a professional manner to enhance the employability skills. This unit will address current and future issues within the IT industry with a focus on gender equity and diversity, to ensure future IT leaders are well placed to address these (and other) challenges and succeed professionally.
